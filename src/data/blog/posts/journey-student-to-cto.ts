  content: `# My Journey: From Student to CTO

Looking back at my career journey, I'm amazed at how far I've come. From organizing coding competitions in university to leading technology strategy as a CTO. Here's my story.

## The Beginning: University Days

At FUTMINNA, I wasn't just focused on getting good grades. I was:

- Organizing Google Hash Code Competitions
- Leading NACOSS as Director of Software
- Co-founding FUTMINNA DevCircle
- Running workshops and bootcamps

These experiences taught me leadership, community building, and the importance of giving back.

## First Steps in the Industry

My first professional role was at Asusu Technology as a Full Stack Developer. Key lessons:

1. **Communication is crucial**: Technical skills aren't enough
2. **Learn the business**: Understand why you're building what you're building
3. **Embrace feedback**: Every code review is a learning opportunity

## The Pivot to Web3 and Blockchain

Working with Quantum Tech LLC on Web3 projects opened my eyes to decentralized technologies. I learned:

- New paradigms require new thinking
- The importance of security in decentralized systems
- How to work with global, distributed teams

## Scaling at Clafiya

At Clafiya, I led frontend development that helped secure $610,000 in Series A funding. This taught me:

- **Impact matters**: Your code directly affects business outcomes
- **Architecture for scale**: Building for 10 users vs 1000+ is different
- **Team collaboration**: Working with cross-functional teams

## Becoming a CTO

As CTO at SweetRide Nigeria, I learned that leadership is about:

- **Vision**: Setting technical direction
- **Mentorship**: Growing your team
- **Strategy**: Balancing innovation with stability
- **Execution**: Shipping products that matter

## Working with Government

My work with the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs taught me:

- The unique challenges of government tech
- The importance of security and compliance
- How technology can improve national capabilities
- The responsibility that comes with handling sensitive data

## Key Lessons

1. **Never stop learning**: Technology evolves rapidly
2. **Build in public**: Share your knowledge
3. **Give back**: Mentor others
4. **Focus on impact**: Not just cool tech
5. **Balance**: Technical excellence with business value

## What's Next?

I'm excited about:

- AI governance and ethics
- Digital transformation in Africa
- Mentoring the next generation
- Building solutions that matter

## My Advice to Aspiring Developers

1. Start building today
2. Contribute to open source
3. Network and attend events
4. Don't just code—understand the business
5. Be patient—success takes time
